**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron + Strapi v4 in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation with a [Strapi v4 CMS](https://strapi.io/) integrated.

This Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.

## Better Sqlite3 Build problem 

If you run `npm run electron-build` you may run into the following error:

```bash
better_sqlite3.node was compiled against a different Node.js version using
NODE_MODULE_VERSION 93. This version of Node.js requires
NODE_MODULE_VERSION 106. Please try re-compiling or re-installing
```

To fix this problem you can simply go the following page [Releases Â· WiseLibs/better-sqlite3 (github.com)](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/releases), find the correct build version you need and paste the `better_sqlite3.node` into `/node_modules/better-sqlite3/build/Release`.

In my case, using windows and `NODE_MODULE_VERSION 106` I downloaded the following file: `better-sqlite3-v7.6.2-electron-v106-win32-x64.tar.gz`
